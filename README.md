# Memory Card!
**What?** A one-player memory card game built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) ([instructions here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-memory-card)) using React.js to practice using lifecycle methods and hooks.

The goal of the game is to successively click on each of the ten cards without ever clicking again on a same card. The player must thus recall which cards they've already clicked on. The twist: their location on the UI is randomized after every click! 

Each click on a new card increments the score by 1; the maximal score one can reach is 10. Clicking on a card that's previously been clicked resets the score back to 0.

**When?** April - May 2022.
